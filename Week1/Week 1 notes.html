<!--Local Storage reading notes
input= what's given to computer output= info given to user
The program below uses the 3 button functions to save the story to localStorage 
and reload it when requested.  Other important things to note include that sections take 
whole width of the document, and to refer to the display you use .innerHTML not .value-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Story Editor</title>
    <script>
        function loadStory(){
            var storyName = document.getElementById("name_input").value 
            var storyHTML = localStorage.getItem(storyName)
            document.getElementById("story_editor").value = storyHTML 

        }
        function saveStory(){
            var storyName= document.getElementById("name_input").value
            var storyHTML = document.getElementById("story_editor").value
            localStorage.setItem(storyName,storyHTML)

        }
        function displayStory(){
            var storyHTML= document.getElementById("story_editor").value
            document.getElementById("story_display").innerHTML=storyHTML

        }
    </script>
    <style>
        textarea{
            width: 800px;
            height: 250px;
            background-color: lightyellow;
        }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>Story Editor</h1>
      Story Name: <input id=name_input></input>

<!--Master Moble UX Notes
Always focuse on mobile first design.  Everything should be designed to view on phone screen and then 
can be made big screen friendly after.  Mobile first is not the same as responsive design. Start small 
and scale up. Be there-help the user through the journey.  Be Useful- users leave if you don't satisfy their needs.
Be Quick- faster access is best.  short attention spans. Most people use a phone with a one handed grip to operate the device.
Things should be easy to reach based on how people hold devices. Also don't assume everyone has latest and greatest.  Reduce image use
SVG/Webfonts, optimize the code, gzip files to reduce data required.  Move primary controls to bottom whenever possible.  
Most used buttons need to be on bottom.  Hamburger menu isn't universally clear...needs to be labled menu. Users
will switch to different system instead of complaining.  Forms are hard for mobiles.  Ditch labels and use floating labels or placeholders instead.  
Only ask for information that are absolutely needed.  Use progress indicators if your break it up into lots of pages.
Enable autofil. Mobiles need feature to show/hide password. Auto format numbers. Auto advance to next field. Make sure
numbers only boxes bring up the keypad and not the keyboard.  Use anchor tag for phone numbers so they don't need to copy and paste.
Pay attention to how people respond to ads.  Make sure ads are sized for mobile and not desktop.  Everyone hates pop-ups or inbetweener ads. 
Make ads small and simple.  Don't use pop-ups and pop-overs.  Keep it as unobstrusive as possible.  -->
